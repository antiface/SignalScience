* The idea is to have the least messaging possible within the organization.
* Messages are costly and costs should be minimized within the communication system.
* The default response to all incoming messages should be => NO RESPONSE.
* It is a kind of "null hypothesis" =>
        * i.e. "a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena."
        * Meaning => No Response is Required (by default).
* Then what happens is with each incoming message, one needs to know =>
      * Is it an Emergency? Yes/No.
      * Is it Urgent? Yes/No.
      * Does it Require a Response or Action? Yes/No.
* So you start with the default of no response / no reaction, then do a kind of "Field Triage" accordingly.

* Minimizing message-passing in this way will save you so much time and energy.
* In essence, being RESPONSIVE involves knowing when NOT TO RESPOND.
* The fundamental thing is that you do not respond, by default.
* Then there are grades of things that you respond to in different yet regular ways.
* If there is no emergency, no urgency, no required response, then no action is taken.
* This is the "default" state of any communication system.
* There must, however, be an "alarum bell" => There has to be a special signal for EMERGENCIES.
* Signals are costly and so we need to minimize their use.

* In essence, when collaborating within a given group structure, messaging quickly becomes
a kind of "scheduling optimization problem".
* Collaboration is in itself an optimization problem.
* What I find useful to remember is that humans exhibit both "bursty" behavior
as well as slower, longer, more "long-tailed" behaviors/distributions.
* In a group, you have moments when communications are more "bursty" in nature and form,
such as when the group convenes to have a Meeting or Conference in "real-time".
* Here everyone comes together and decisions are made, things are said, in a "bursty" manner.
* There are other times, however, when people are mostly "doing their own thing",
communications "slow" down and you get what I call the "Long-Tail of Analysis".
* Now, with that being said, it is important to try to SYNCHRONIZE peoples and
communications into BURSTY time-slots/distributions.
* It's important to synchronize the BURSTS/bursty behaviors, because that's
when you run the chance of getting the most WORK DONE (if doing work is what you prize).
* Then in the more "latent" phases, people can mind their own bee's-wax and work in
an ASYNCHRONOUS MODE (of the Heavy Tail/Long Tail).
