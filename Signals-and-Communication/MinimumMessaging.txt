* The idea is to have the least messaging possible within the organization.
* Messages are costly and costs should be minimized within the communication system.
* The default response to all incoming messages should be => NO RESPONSE.
* It is a kind of "null hypothesis" =>
        * i.e. "a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena."
        * Meaning => No Response is Required (by default).
* Then what happens is with each incoming message, one needs to know =>
      * Is it an Emergency? Yes/No.
      * Is it Urgent? Yes/No.
      * Does it Require a Response or Action? Yes/No.
* So you start with the default of no response / no reaction, then do a kind of "Field Triage" accordingly.
