INTERFERENCE THEORY:
===================
* Theory of Multiple Interferences
* Interferometry as Art Form

Perhaps the most beautiful part of a good Interference Theory like this is that it marries actual Interference Theory in the actual field of Interferometry and so forth, except that here it is also:
* The Interference Theory is an Explanation for How Culture Works as It Is Passed Down Across Time and Place (History, see: The Historiome).
* It can also be used to formulate Interferometry itself AS ART FORM, meaning:
* *One can use Signal Science and Articulatio and Discursive Structures and Data Types and the Noise Field Theory and so forth to endlessly make beautiful art that is highly resistant to corruption, like in way perhaps never seen since the days of the Arsenal of Venice, or even before that.
* It has the added advantage of being based on the concept of the noise-bit which is a 1-bit chip that sets off noise-lines that are like the propagation of cracks. At any given moment in History one can see the Universe being covered by a massive Noise-Field, similar to a Finite Field, and at that instant what you see is the effects that the noise-bits have had as they created lesser or greater cascades called Noises (which tend to be Interference Fringe Patterns).
* See: Field of Discourse, Field of Experience
* The problem is as soon as people see you, they want to hunt you down and kill Culture and its propagation which is natural because:
* They fear the further propagation of the Civilization Virus. More on that when it is more appropriate.
* For now that is enough. GOTO: WHY RADIANT THINKING SAVED OUR HUMANITY, The Art of the Found, The Art of Finding Ourselves, The Eureka Moment, Genius in the true ancient Greek philosophic sense. Being possessed by Inspiration, the Breath. And I assure you that no one knows this even those who are seemingly the most "religious" because Religion itself is just one of many ways of passing on cultural knowledge, the professional abstract knowledge.
